 # Engineering-Assignment-1

 ## Install project dependencies:
   npm install

## Running the Application:
   npm run dev

## Features:
  Filtering: You can filter transactions based on different categories such as credit, debit, salary, or bill payment.
  Date Range: You can specify a date range to view transactions that occurred within that period.
  Search: You can search for specific transactions by their descriptions.

## Technologies Used:
 React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
 Redux Toolkit: A state management library for managing application state.
 Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.

   I completed the assignment as asked. Instead of using an API, I stored data in an array using a JS file.
Instead of using an external API, this project utilizes JSON data stored in a JavaScript file to simulate transaction data. The data is stored in arrays and objects within the code, providing a self-contained environment for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, transaction data would typically be fetched from an external API or a database. This approach simplifies setup and allows for easier exploration and testing of the filtering and search features.
